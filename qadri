Before embarking on your journey to study medicine in Germany, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the admission requirements. While the specifics may vary depending on the university, certain prerequisites are common across most institutions:
Academic Qualifications: Prospective students are typically required to hold a secondary school certificate or its equivalent, demonstrating proficiency in subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
